    <option value="•	Corn plants are picky about their soil. Work in aged manure or compost the fall before planting and let it overwinter in the soil.<br>
•	Starting corn seeds indoors is not recommended.<br>
•	Plant seeds outdoors two weeks after the last spring frost date.<br>
•	Make sure the soil temperature is above 60°F (16°C) for successful germination. (Up to 65°F/18°C for super sweet varieties.) In colder zones, the ground can be warmed by a black plastic cover if necessary. Plant seeds through holes in the plastic.<br>
•	Plant seeds 1.5 to 2 inches deep and 4 to 6 inches apart. Rows 30 to 36 inches apart.<br>
•	For sufficient pollination, plan your plot right. Don’t plant two long rows, rather, plant corn blocks of at least four rows.<br>
•	You may choose to fertilize at planting time; corn is meant to grow rapidly. If you are confident that the soil is adequate, this can be skipped.<br>
•	Water well at planting time<br>
">Corn</option>
    <option value="•	Long vegetation periods (175 to 225 days) without frost. <br>
•	Constant temperatures between 18 and 30°. <br>
•	Ample sunshine and fairly dry conditions. <br>
•	A minimum of 500 mm of water between germination and boll formation. <br>
•	Deep, well-drained soils with a good nutrient content<br>

">Cotton</option>
    <option value="When it comes to vegetable gardening, the most important elements to focus on are soil, sunlight, plant types, and maintenance.<br>

Soil in the vegetable garden should be loose and include organic matter<br>

While some vegetables may tolerate small amounts of shade, most crops depend on at least eight hours of full sun in order to grow properly and maintain overall health.<br>

Maintenance is important for vegetable gardening, too. Avoid planting too many vegetable plants or those with which you are unfamiliar<br>

    <option value="Temperature: 15°-30°C<br>
Rainfall: 30-50 cm      <br>  
Soil: loam to clayey loam <br>
">Oil seeds</option>
    <option value="Rice
•	A monthly rainfall of 100-200 mm is a must and about 125 cm is during vegetative season. And there should be no water at ripening stage.<br>
•	, requires a fairly high temperature, ranging from 20° to 40°C. The optimum temperature of 30°C during day time and 20°C during night time <br>
•	 grown well on the alluvial soil or on the fertile river basins. clayey loam is well suited to the raising of this crop.<br>
•	The amount of solar radiation received during the 45 days leading up to harvest determines final crop output.">Rice</option>
    <option value="•	Temperatures of at least 15 degrees C are needed to germinate the seed and mean temperatures of 20-25 C to grow the crop.<br>
•	Soybeans need at least moderate soil moisture in order to germinate and for seedlings to become established, but need dry weather for the production of dry seed.<br>
•	Soybean is moderately drought tolerant requiring a minimum of 400mm of well distributed rainfall during the vegetative growth period which lasts 3-4 months<br>
•	Soybeans can grow on a wide range of soils but thrive best on sand, clay loams and alluvial soil of good fertility. The soils should be well drained, fertile and rich in calcium with a pH range of 5.6-7.0.<br>
">Soybean </option>
    <option value="Temperature: 20°-35°C<br>
Rainfall: 85-165 cm<br>
Soil: Well-drained alluvium, black, red and brown regur soil <br>
 A total rainfall between 1100 and 1500 mm is adequate provided the distribution is right, abundant in the months of vegetative growth followed by a dry period for ripening<br>
 High humidity (80-85%) favours rapid cane elongation during grand growth period. A moderate value of 45-65% coupled with limited water supply is favourable during the ripening phase.<br>

">Sugarcane</option>
    <option value="Temperature: 15°-27°C<br>
Rainfall: 65-125 cm<br>
Soil: Deep-heavy clay to light sandy loam <br>
">Maize</option>
    <option value="•	Temperature: 20° to 30°C <br>
•	Rainfall: 50° cms to 75 cms<br>
•	These can be grown on all types of soils but a dry light soil is best suited.<br>
">Pulses</option>
    <option value="•	Wheat needs 12 to 15 inches (31 to 38 centimeters) of water to produce a good crop.<br>
•	It grows best when temperatures are warm, from 70° to 75° F (21° to 24° C), but not too hot.<br>
•	Wheat also needs a lot of sunshine, especially when the grains are filling. <br>
•	Areas with low humidity are better since many wheat diseases thrive in damp weather<br>
